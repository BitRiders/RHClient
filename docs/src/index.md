# RHClient Documentation
Full implementation of Julia Client.

A client for Rest Harness, a robust tool that acts to stand in place of another RESTful service. This can be used to mock out a service that doesn't yet exist or where there is a need to reproduce a particular set of inputs from an opaque service. It can also serve as a simple shared cache. This software runs as a daemon service by default. This library contains a client developed in Julia that can be used to interact with Rest Harness.
